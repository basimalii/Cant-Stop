# Can't Stop
Created the Java-based, object-oriented game "Can't Stop!" to demonstrate a
solid grasp of essential software engineering principles like polymorphism,
encapsulation, abstraction, and AI integration. The project's triumph stemmed from
its exceptional modular design, marked by low coupling and high cohesion.
Demonstrated strong teamwork skills by collaborating effectively to deliver the
project.
